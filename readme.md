Learning Laravel
=========

Basically this repo is me exploring and trying to understand how laravel works. It's my first time going into MVC so this should be intresting.

Current things to take away from this:
* summernote implementation, it works but I probably need to refine how I'm using it a better. The function for uploading the image is nice but I feel like I need a way to stop just anyone sending a post to the route as you can tell how its handled by client side .js currently. I also need to implement a way for the user to know that its currently uploading an image, probably some jQuery hide/show or fadein/fadeout combo to be used for this.

Currently half of whats on here is from laracasts and soon even more will be as I go through more and more of them.
